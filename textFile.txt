DataInputStream and DataOutputStream read and write Java primitive-type values
and strings in a machine-independent fashion, thereby enabling you to write a data file on one
machine and read it on another machine that has a different operating system or file structure.
An application uses a data output stream to write data that can later be read by a program using
a data input stream.
